This will be like turbo-charged Markdown!
There are two things to note here:

First, we just imported and used a React component directly inside Markdown! Let that sink in for a moment, because this is an incredibly powerful concept. (Imagine blog posts with animated charts and/or dynamically loaded data, complex interactivity, and more.)
Second, you may have noticed that we are able to access the frontmatter values from props.pageContext.frontmatter. This can be quite useful, too!
Important: If your MDX files contain frontmatter, always place any import statements after the frontmatter block!

Go ahead and view the updated page in your browser, and try editing the size and bkgdColor props to watch it update. Itâ€™s a really simple example, but again: we are using a React component inside Markdown! Pretty sweet, right?!
